Background: At [EduGorilla Directory Listing](https://directory.edugorilla.com) Portal, we receive 50+ queries every day. We have more than 40,000 Coaching centers, which are increasing at a rate of 1 Institute per 40secs, listed on our website.

We have to come with a transparent platform of all the leads on our website. There are two aspects of this project:

1. Promotional Lead: These leads will be forwarded to all the people in that category for free
2. Sellable leads: These leads can be sold in the market. People can buy them.

## Promotional Lead:

 We would get the leads accumulated in our database and send it in email to the interested parties.
   
## Sellable leads:
  The marketing manager/Owner of the institute will be the user of this portal and they use the credits present in their account to get the details of leads(email/phone of people interested). 

### Requirements (Step 1):

Create a form to add following details

1. A)Name of lead:
2. B)Contact Number of lead:
3. C)Email ID of lead:
4. D)Query Link or query of lead:
5. E)User Location
6. F)Query Category

### Requirements (Step 2):

Show the details of all the fetched Leads. They should be properly hyperlinked.

1. Users should be able to purchase definite number of EduCash from their account.
